Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Software Testing of the Hostel Management System! This project is dedicated to ensuring the robustness, reliability, and overall quality of the Hostel Management System through comprehensive software testing practices.

# Project Setup

Download PHP from https://www.php.net/downloads

After downloading, extract the contents of the zip file to a directory of your choice. Let's say you extract it to C:\php.

Add the PHP directory to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows you to run PHP from any command prompt window.

Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" on your desktop or in File Explorer.
Select "Properties."
Click on "Advanced system settings" on the left.
Click the "Environment Variables" button.
Under "System variables," find and select the "Path" variable, then click "Edit."
Click "New" and add the path to your PHP directory (e.g., C:\php).
Click "OK" to close each dialog.

### Verify Installation

```sh
php -v
```

###  Test a PHP File

```sh
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```

### to execute the PHP file

```sh
php test.php
```
